## Professional Experience

**NewDay**  
*Senior Software Engineer, Feb 2020 - Oct 2022*
 - Led a team of 3 developers to successfully implement backend API services required for Google and Apple mobile Wallet integration, enabling customers to add their NewDay cards to their mobile wallets and make payments using their smartphones.
 - Led a team of 3 developers to implement a new AML journey called "Penny Drop" which was designed to be less intrusive and more user-friendly than the traditional AML checks.
 - Worked on the Open Banking solution to implement PSD2 requirements and integrated it with NewDay's in-house Identity Management solution. The solution enabled customers to securely connect their NewDay accounts with third-party financial apps and services.
 - Developed a highly configurable Strong Customer Authentication service, which included e-commerce transactions and other secure actions that required 2FA. Utilized metrics and other data points to build a custom Grafana dashboard for service uptime and 3rd party dependency monitoring. These dashboards provided valuable insights which led to improvements in application stability and performance.

*Software Engineer, April 2018 - Jan 2020*
 - Worked in our Own-Brands team as both a front and backend engineer.
 - Built out the services to include AML checks within the Acquisition web journey.
 - Worked with existing product teams to determine common domains and then built out these out as domain API services. SDKs were also built for teams to easily integrate with the new services.

**ICBC Standard Bank**  
Software Engineer - *Aug 2015 - Sept 2017*
 - Developed an in-house incident reporting application in collaboration with the front office team. This involved working closely with stakeholders to understand their requirements, and building an application that met their needs while also adhering to best practices for security and reliability.
 - Created an interactive dashboard for managers that provided a high-level view of the state of the incident reporting application. This dashboard allowed managers to quickly identify issues and track progress towards resolving them, improving overall efficiency and reducing downtime.
 - Developed an internal toolkit to automate common, and otherwise manual, tasks such as trade validation and trade file loading, which was used by team mates for testing and development. This toolkit improved overall efficiency and reduced the risk of human errors.
 - Setting up and managing scheduled and ad hoc file transfers using GoAnywhere's MFT solution. This involved configuring and testing the file transfer workflows to ensure they were reliable and secure.
 - Creating and supporting real-time and batch interfaces to feed trade data to the appropriate target systems. 
 - Managing and updating the message queue setup as part of a large application upgrade

## Projects

**Crypto Command Centre**  
*An extensible command line tool to easily manage common tasks across chains and exchanges*  
 - Implemented commands to programatically move assets from one venue to another.
 - Added the ability to quickly find the venue with the highest yield for a given asset (LP, staking, other), as well as the ability to move or remove the asset from the yield provider.
 - Exposed the CLI tool via a Telegram bot.

**Crypto Arb Bot**  
*An arbitrage trading bot for crypto currencies*
 - Developed a trading bot that analyzes the possible arbitrage yields across multiple crypto currency exchanges, taking into account funding rates for perpetual futures contracts and interest rates for borrowing spot assets.
 - Implemented multiple order execution strategies, including limit and market orders, to maximize profit potential while minimizing risk.
 - Utilized APIs from various exchanges to gather data and make real-time trading decisions.
 - Demonstrated the ability to generate consistent profits through successful arbitrage trades on multiple cryptocurrency exchanges.

**NewDay Hackathon 2022**  
*Carbon Footprint Tracker*
 - Worked over a weekend with a team of 4 developers to create a carbon footprint tracker that integrated with NewDay's Transactions API and external data providers to calculate the carbon cost of each transaction made by a customer.
 - Developed the backend API services and integrated with a third-party provider to plant a tree when a customer made a number of "green alternative" transactions.
 - The app was highly commended by judges and received positive feedback from NewDay's senior management.

**NewDay Hackathon 2020**  
*Realtime Customer AML Checks using Passport Data*
 - Worked with a team of 3 developers to create a proof-of-concept mobile app that used  customer selfies along with machine learning algorithms to analyze passport data and perform real-time anti-money laundering (AML) checks.
 - The app won third place in the hackathon, with judges praising its innovative approach to AML compliance.

**University Final Year Project**  
*Value at Risk and Financial Modeling*  
 - Created a value-at-risk (VaR) model in Java to estimate the maximum possible loss of an investment portfolio at a given confidence level.
 - Used statistical techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations and historical data analysis to produce accurate risk estimates.
 - Presented findings to academic staff and industry professionals at a student conference.
