        I chose to do my final year project on the subject of Value at Risk, which focuses on risk management of financial assets.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Implemented different approaches of Value at Risk calculation, including Historical Simulation, Model Building and Monte Carlo Simulation.
            \item Analysed the accuracy of my implementation of each approach using backtesting and stress-testing.
            \item Allowed financial derivatives to be part of the portfolio.
            \item Gave a presentation of my program to my peers and project supervisors.
        \end{itemize}
